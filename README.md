# PingPong
##
This is a short game I created for my thrid year module for Data and Machine Learning for Creative pratce. This is a creative project that uses machine learning and/or data analysis techniques explored within the module. For this project I decided to make a simple game which was a pong game that is played against an AI but intsead of using the keyboard you would using your hands to control the ball. 

## Getting Started

Click on this link to play the game:

Reminder: When playing the game make sure you move your hands within the screen and not not go out of the screen or else it won't detect your hand 

## Preview of the game

## Built with 

- This was done with Javascript by using P5.js libray: https://p5js.org/
- Teachable machine which is a web based tool that allows you to create machine laerning models. The models that are made are TensorFlow.js so it is able to run anywhere javascript runs which includes P5.js: teachablemachine.withgoogle.com 

## Inspired By 

This was inspired by my two classmate using teachable machine learning to help produce their project. When reserching I saw alot could be done as teachable machine is flexible in terms of capturing live samples. 

My second inspiration is the Youtube channel The Coding Train which is a Youtube channel that explores P5.js libray and shows the varity of ways of using the P5 libray. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPgxnGC8oBU: This video showed how teachable machine can be incoorpated within the P5 libray.
