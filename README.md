# PingPong

This is a short game I created for my third-year module for Data and Machine Learning for Creative practice. This is a creative project that uses machine learning and/or data analysis techniques explored within the module. For this project, I decided to make a simple game which was a pong game that is played against an AI but instead of using the keyboard, you would use your hands to control the ball. 

## Getting Started

Click on this link to play the game:

Reminder: When playing the game make sure you move your hands within the screen and not go out of the screen or else it won't detect your hand 

## Preview of the game

## Built with 

- This was done with Javascript by using P5.js libray: https://p5js.org/
- Teachable machine which is a web-based tool that allows you to create machine learning models. The models that are made are TensorFlow.js so it can run anywhere javascript runs which includes P5.js: teachablemachine.withgoogle.com 

## Inspired By 

This was inspired by my two classmates using teachable machine learning to help produce their project. When researching I saw a lot could be done as a teachable machine is flexible in terms of capturing live samples. 

My second inspiration is the Youtube channel The Coding Train which is a Youtube channel that explores the P5.js library and shows the variety of ways of using the P5 library. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPgxnGC8oBU: This video showed how a teachable machine can be incorporated within the P5 library.  

## Bugs

There are a few bugs that I am currently fixing. Hopefully it will be fixed soon. 

Enjoy!!!!!
